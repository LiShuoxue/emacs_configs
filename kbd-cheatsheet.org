** Emacs Client

1. Start an emacs server by ~emacs --daemon~
2. Then execute ~emacsclient path-to-your-folder~ to immediately open the emacs.
3. Open vterm in the emacsclient and salloc the interactive task, which cannot be killed if we exit the emacsclient, the same principle as tmux
4. If we accidentally suspend emacsclient, we cannot fetch it by `emacsclient`, instead, use `fg` (job foreground command) to reopen the suspended emacsclient job.
5. If we quit the emacsclient by ~C-x C-c~, then after we reopen it, all the buffers exist, but the layout of buffers is *NOT* saved. Instead, we can suspend with ~C-c C-z~, and use fg to restore it.
